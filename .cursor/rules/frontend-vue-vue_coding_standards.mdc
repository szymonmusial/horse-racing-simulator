### Guidelines for VUE

#### VUE_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use the Composition API instead of the Options API for better type inference and code reuse
- Implement <script setup> for more concise component definitions
- Use Suspense and async components for handling loading states during code-splitting
- Leverage the defineProps and defineEmits macros for type-safe props and events
- Use the new defineOptions for additional component options
- Implement provide/inject for dependency injection instead of prop drilling in deeply nested components
- Use the Teleport component for portal-like functionality to render UI elsewhere in the DOM
- Leverage ref over reactive for primitive values to avoid unintended unwrapping
- Use v-memo for performance optimization in render-heavy list rendering scenarios
- Implement shallow refs for large objects that don't need deep reactivity
- Prefer arrow functions (`=>`) instead of `function` declarations and expressions for callbacks, handlers, and non-method functions
- In single-file components (.vue) use this section order: **template**, **script**, **style** (include style only when needed)
- Use the `@` alias for imports (e.g. `@/components/...`, `@/types/...`) instead of relative paths
- Add `data-testid` to relevant elements in components for testing; use static values in the template (do not pass data-testid as a prop)
