### Guidelines for VUE

#### PINIA

- Create multiple stores based on logical domains instead of a single large store
- Use the setup syntax (defineStore with setup function) for defining stores for better TypeScript inference
- Implement getters for derived state to avoid redundant computations
- Leverage the storeToRefs helper to extract reactive properties while maintaining reactivity
- Use plugins for cross-cutting concerns like persistence, state resets, or dev tools
- Implement actions for asynchronous operations and complex state mutations
- Use composable stores by importing and using stores within other stores
- Leverage the $reset() method to restore initial state when needed
- Implement $subscribe for reactive store subscriptions
- Use TypeScript with proper return type annotations for maximum type safety
